# Deadline2
An update of the Anki Deadline addon for GUI configuration. 

Work was originally started at https://gist.github.com/eshapard/12c14947d31dfcb8f0915761fb649c32
I had originally started off by just making this into an Anki 2.1 compatible addon (move deadline.py into __init__.py and you're off to the races)

Next, folks asked if I could make it a little bit easier to use by creating a configuration menu. 
Inspiration was taken from https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1102281552 and https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155 , along with bits of their code.
